# LLM Agents Workflow Course

Public course materials about LLM agents by Unity Zone Zero team

## Motivation

My name is Vasilisa Versus, and I love learning - and learning is more fun together! With my friends ([Unity Zone Zero](https://uz0.dev/) team), we collect interesting things about development using advanced pipelines. Of course, we learn by building LLM services. Everything is developing and changing very quickly, and all materials here are rather our drafts and notes that we will organize as we have time and energy. Join us all on [GitHub](https://github.com/uz0/llm)

## Materials

### [01. Prompt Engineering Fundamentals](01_prompt.md)
Learn how LLMs work and master effective prompt writing techniques for reliable, consistent results with practical examples.

### [02. Context Management](02_context.md)
Master context window optimization, token economics, and cost control strategies for efficient LLM interactions.

### [03. Claude Code CLI & Sub-agents](03_claudecode.md)
Practical guide to using Claude Code CLI, sub-agent orchestration, and advanced development workflows with real examples.

### [04. Basic Agent Patterns](04_baseagents.md) 🚧 IN DEVELOPMENT
Introduction to fundamental agent patterns including Chain of Thought, tools integration, RAG basics, and building your first agent.

### [B1. Advanced Agent Implementation](05_agents_advanced.md)
Build production-ready agent systems with advanced error handling, recovery mechanisms, and performance optimization techniques. **PDF Version**: [Download the complete analysis (PDF)](B1_agents_architecture.pdf)
