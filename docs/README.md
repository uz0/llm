# LLM Agents Workflow Course - Documentation

This directory contains the structured course materials for the LLM Agents Workflow Course. Each module builds upon previous concepts to provide a comprehensive learning path.

## 📚 Course Modules

## [01_prompt](01_prompt.md)
Learn the fundamentals of writing effective prompts that produce reliable, consistent results from LLMs. This module covers prompt engineering patterns, common pitfalls, and practical techniques for getting predictable outputs.

## [02_context](02_context.md)
Master context window management, token economics, and optimization strategies. Understand how to efficiently manage LLM context, control costs, and prevent context pollution in long conversations and complex tasks.

## [03_claudecode](03_claudecode.md)
Practical guide to using Claude Code CLI, sub-agent orchestration, and advanced workflows. Learn to install, configure, and effectively use Claude Code for development tasks with hands-on examples.

## [04_baseagents](04_baseagents.md)
Introduction to fundamental agent patterns and simple implementation strategies. Understand the basics of agent design, state management, error handling, and how to build your first functional agents.

## [B1_agents_architecture](B1_agents_architecture.md)
In-depth analysis of production-ready agent architectures with performance comparisons. Explore advanced patterns like ReAct, Self-Ask, Tree of Thoughts, and comprehensive benchmarking results.

## 🚀 Learning Path

We recommend following the modules in order:

1. **Start with** [01_prompt](01_prompt.md) - Master prompt engineering fundamentals
2. **Continue with** [02_context](02_context.md) - Understand context management
3. **Practice with** [03_claudecode](03_claudecode.md) - Apply concepts using Claude Code
4. **Build with** [04_baseagents](04_baseagents.md) - Create your first agents
5. **Advanced topics** in [B1_agents_architecture](B1_agents_architecture.md) - Production-ready patterns
