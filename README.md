# LLM Agents Workflow Course

**Public course materials about LLM agents workflow by Unity Zone Zero team**

## 🎯 Motivation

Large Language Models have transformed how we approach software development, research, and problem-solving. However, working effectively with LLM agents requires understanding their fundamental nature, limitations, and best practices. This course bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, providing developers with the skills needed to build robust, efficient, and reliable agent-based workflows.

The materials are designed to help you:
- Understand the statistical nature of LLMs and their limitations
- Master context management and token economics
- Learn proven agent architectures and patterns
- Develop practical skills with real-world examples
- Build production-ready agent systems

## 📚 Course Materials

### Core Documentation

Our course is structured as a progressive learning path, with each document building upon previous concepts:

| Module | Topic | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **[01_prompt](docs/01_prompt.md)** | Prompt Engineering Fundamentals | Learn how to write effective prompts that produce reliable, consistent results from LLMs |
| **[02_context](docs/02_context.md)** | Context Management | Master context window management, token economics, and optimization strategies |
| **[03_claudecode](docs/03_claudecode.md)** | Claude Code CLI & Sub-agents | Practical guide to using Claude Code CLI, sub-agent orchestration, and advanced workflows |
| **[04_baseagents](docs/04_baseagents.md)** | Basic Agent Patterns | Introduction to fundamental agent patterns and simple implementation strategies |
| **[B1_agents_architecture](docs/B1_agents_architecture.md)** | Advanced Agent Architectures | In-depth analysis of production-ready agent architectures with performance comparisons |
