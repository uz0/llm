# LLM Agents Workflow Course

**Public course materials about LLM agents workflow by Unity Zone Zero team**

## 🎯 Motivation

Large Language Models have transformed how we approach software development, research, and problem-solving. However, working effectively with LLM agents requires understanding their fundamental nature, limitations, and best practices. This course bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, providing developers with the skills needed to build robust, efficient, and reliable agent-based workflows.

The materials are designed to help you:
- Understand the statistical nature of LLMs and their limitations
- Master context management and token economics
- Learn proven agent architectures and patterns
- Develop practical skills with real-world examples
- Build production-ready agent systems
